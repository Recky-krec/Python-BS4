# youtube-searcher
This is a youtube link searcher made with python and beautifulsoup4.

The "(with-titles)" version also parses for the videos titles and return them accordingly.

After that, a new file called "found_urls.txt" will appear with a list of urls ordered from the most relevant to less relevant
